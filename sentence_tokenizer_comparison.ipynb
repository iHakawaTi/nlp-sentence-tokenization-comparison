        "This notebook aims to compare the performance of different sentence tokenization techniques in Python. We will analyze how three distinct methods—RegexpTokenizer, sent_tokenize (from NLTK), and PunktSentenceTokenizer (also from NLTK)—handle various text types, including standard prose, unconventional punctuation, and abbreviations.\n",
        "\n",
        "The comparison will focus on:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Accuracy: Which tokenizer correctly identifies sentence boundaries?\n",
        "\n",
        "* Efficiency: How do their runtimes compare on different texts?\n",
        "\n",
        "* Robustness: How well do they handle surprising or non-standard text patterns?\n",
        "\n",
        "The ultimate goal is to determine which tokenizer is the most suitable for a variety of general-purpose Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks."

The fact that this is the go-to service for young people's mental health is truly scary.It is difficult to know where to start with just how bad our experience has been.• The waiting times are often of two years or more.• The treatment offered is of little use, often consisting of online forums and vague parental self help programs that are simply unfit for purpose.• Upon completing a course of this 'treatment' the young person is simply discharged with no follow on care, and no escalation of care if that initial course of treatment has proved ineffective.• We were offered involvement with an online forum. There is no user verification with this forum, meaning that anyone of any age could begin conversations with vulnerable young people. It does not appear to be moderated in any way. A majority of the accounts on it are automated bots with no human involvement behind them. The fact that this is considered treatment for mental health conditions is nothing short of scandalous.• Upon making a complaint, I was told that the CAMHS service was decimated by COVID and lockdown. COVID was over 5 years ago. I would have expected somebody to have dragged the service back into something resembling normalcy by now. I suspect that the poor service on offer now is regarded as normal.\n",

            "Original Text: I recently gave birth in the Ulster hospital and wanted to provide feedback on the care received.I was admitted to the induction bay, which had been preplanned. Stephanie who was taking care of me upon admission and throughout the day was brilliant and took her time to run through and explain everything. I did feel for her however as she was running the bay alone and given how busy it was, I'm sure another pair of hands would have been helpful. Our care was then handed over to Concepta (and another lovely lady who unfortunately I cannot remember her name!) for the evening. It was over the course of the evening that I went into labour and Concepta was brilliant, so down to earth and able to speak with honestly about the situation, which was much appreciated. I still had the choice to proceed to home from home or move to labour ward. As this was my first pregnancy and I was 1. Unsure of how much further pain I would be in, and 2. I didn't want to go to home from home unit and have to return back upstairs, I decided to go to the labour ward as this felt more straightforward.The handover from induction by the other lady (apologies!) to Rae and Gemma in the Labour ward was totally seamless! They sprung straight into action and talked me through the birth, although it was assisted by a Dr with the kiwi ventouse and an episitomy. The reasons for the interventions were explained to me and I was happy to proceed. The care from both ladies was  second to none, they made a brilliant team and I couldn't have asked for better. I was surprised to learn Gemma was close to completing her qualification - you would have thought she had been a midwife for years!I was then moved down to the maternity ward and placed in a side room. Whilst it was nice to have privacy and personal space, I do have to echo another review in that it did feel isolating due to the fact that birthing partners had to leave. I understand the rationale behind this with regards to open bays however I feel the policy should be different for side rooms.If I'd of been in the home from home unit following an uncomplicated birth, I would have had the option to have someone stay, whereas my first night was very difficult and overwhelming - a new-born that wouldn't settle at all combined with no sleep since before admission, as well as an uncomfortable wound. This does not bode well for recovery when you are advised to rest but cannot as you do not have that support.I feel the case could be argued that those with the higher care needs would benefit greater to having the additional support and I personally feel my stay on the ward would have been much more positive should I have been able to avail of that additional support of my choosing. I felt it meant trying to rely on midwives for certain things which was not practical nor a good use of resources in my opinion.Lastly I would like to say that the care from the Healthcare and Nursing Assistants on the ward was really good, they made such a difference - for one they advised that breakfast was self serve which I didn't know and at first assumed I'd been forgotten about! Also Lesley who was the midwife overseeing my care upon my day of discharge, she was great and was able to offer great advice on any queries I had.Overall I would say my experience was excellent in the Ulster with the only negative/thing I would change being that of the policy on overnight stays on the maternity ward and would welcome this to be reviewed.\n",
